0,Divyansh, 14 March 2021,5.0 out of 5 stars,I LOVE IT!!!,"Upgraded from iPhone 7. This really is a significant upgrade. I love this size. This is just perfect, you can use it single handedly, easily fits into pockets, reach every corner of the screen easily.I was waiting for this size for so long and finally, after 2 months of buying, I‚Äôm writing a review. Just go for it if you want a small phone. In reality, it‚Äôs not even that small, almost the size of iPhone 7, with full edge to edge display.Feel: Ever used an iPhone 5 (or 4, 5s, SE)? Remember how boxy it was and how good it felt in your hand, with all those edges? Same with this phone. It feels so good to hold in hand with a glass body, it cannot be expressed in words.Display: Phenomenal! OLED display with HDR stuff feels like on a different level. Darks feel dark, and not grays.Sound: Stereo speakers, which really are loud and clear. iPhone 7 also had stereo speakers but on these, there‚Äôs a noticeable difference in loudness, and sound quality.Battery: Many people are criticizing battery, but I‚Äôm not a heavy user, most importantly I‚Äôve been an iPhone user so battery life is decent enough. Much better than iPhone 7, obviously. Easily lasts more than a day. And with a 20w charger, it charges pretty fast too.Security: Upgrading from TouchID to FaceID was a nice experience. I‚Äôm already in love with FaceID. It works every single time (except when you‚Äôre wearing masks, you have to put it down a little bit to let it recognize your face).Camera: I don‚Äôt need to describe this. Do I? But let me tell you the night mode is superb!Accessories: You only get a Type-C to lightening port cable, and a single apple sticker. That‚Äôs it.eSIM functionality works great, WiFi reception is good, call quality is awesome, as you‚Äôd expect. Long story cut short, everything is great when compared with iPhone 7 (which still was working awesome, except storage, and battery after 3 years). The only thing I miss is 3D Touch, and home button, lol.To conclude, it‚Äôs a great buy. I bought 128GB version in black color. Hope it‚Äôs gonna last for a couple of years.Please hit helpful, if you found it helpful."
1,Rohan Chowdhury, 1 March 2021,5.0 out of 5 stars,Need a small phone? Care about privacy? Get this.,"1) If privacy means anything to you, Apple is the answer right now. Google has gone to the path of everything that is wrong with big techs, and it took me 6 months to entirely come out of google ecosystem.2) Best small phone out there, if android isn‚Äôt even an option for point 1, this is the only choice anyway. I waited for the right sized small phone with right specs from apple. It fits perfectly in pocket, in hand, good one hand usage, it‚Äôs blocky enough not to slip out of hand.3) If you‚Äôre taking a small phone, most possibly you have a life and phone isn‚Äôt your life. The charge will live through the day for ‚Äúphone like usage‚Äù. 5 hours screen on time is more than sufficient. For gaming get a gaming PC or console, for big screen get a big screen TV. If you want all in one device, pay more, get a bigger phone, or get a battery pack maybe? I‚Äôm tired of the battery argument, it‚Äôs a ‚Äúphone‚Äù !!4) iOS wasn‚Äôt very easy to understand for someone moving from android first time. But it‚Äôs not too hard either, about a week I was uncomfortable in situations I had to hurry to do something or get something done, after a month usage I forgot the fact I am still new to this. iOS is intuitive enough, simple for anyone to use.5) For whatever reason everything in App store is so costly ! Most app doesn‚Äôt have any India cost adjustment, and they just convert whatever price they have in USD to INR. So be prepared. If you don‚Äôt like ads, get a VPN with ad blocker or any VPN with custom DNS to AdGuard servers.6) Screen quality is brilliant, it‚Äôs vibrant, it‚Äôs crisp, it‚Äôs very colour accurate, get bright enough indoor and outdoor, under sunlight no issues using.7) Speakers are pretty good, stereo setup, had very good lows, doesn‚Äôt crack at high volume, but guess what, if I use earphones for watching videos - battery life goes way better. For watching movies, online courses, better use a earphone, you won‚Äôt realise it has a small battery.8) It doesn‚Äôt come with a charging adapter. I‚Äôm still using my pixel 2 xl charger. Charges fast to 80%, then it‚Äôs a bit slower - but i guess that‚Äôs an expects behaviour.9) The charging cable seems weirdly stiff, I have read only bad reviews about them so be careful handling charging cable, use it with care, it will last long.10) Phone cameras has gone very far these days. It‚Äôs a very good camera here as well. I‚Äôm coming from Pixel 2 XL which had great camera and this one is even better. I don‚Äôt think people really need to bother too much about camera quality here. 4K video recording at 60 FPS .. what do you want more !!"
2,Nitin Jaswant, 17 December 2020,4.0 out of 5 stars,Engineering Marvel,"Recently upgraded from iPhone 8 to iPhone 12 mini and here is my honest feedback:1. This phone is compact powerhouse.2. OLED screen is a huge upgrade over LCD3. iOS 14 looks fresh on iPhone 12 mini when compared to iOS 14 on iPhone 84. Look and feed of the phone is very sturdy and due to its boxy design the hold is very good.5. Unlike rumours of sharp edges, the iPhone edges are not that sharp to hurt your palms6. Got it at an attractive price of 60,900 during sale.7. Sunlight legibility is also good8. Unmatched camera9. Perfect one hand use phone.10. Easily slips in pocket ( I am talking about size)This phone is not for:1. Avoid this phone due to its battery limitations.2. Although the screen is beautiful, the battery is not favorable when u do huge multi-media consumption.3. Lasts for 24 hours when on WiFi with little multi-media usage.4. Take around 1 hour with 5W Apple original adapter & cable to charge 50%5. Hoping that Apple might improve battery with software upgrades but not so wishful about this phone being supportive(in terms of battery) for future iOS Versions.6. Budget upgrade from 4.7‚Äù Apple device.7. In terms of pandemic I miss touch id while making payments for via scanning QR codes.Final comments:Compact powerhouse & engineering marvel having flagship specs in compact for factor.Overall a good upgrade for next 3 years"
3,Durga, 22 February 2021,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best mobile I‚Äôve had in my hand,"It‚Äôs been a month since I bought this little fella and I‚Äôm in real love. I switched from android so it‚Äôs so great to explore iOS and to have the best mini mobile that apple ever made.I was in the idea to buy SE2020 as it looked handy and twas budget friendly. But my friends suggested to go with the mini if I‚Äôm looking for a smaller phone. Yes, it‚Äôs almost twice the budget of SE, I was worried to spend much at first but, believe me, no regrets at all after using it for a while!!The screen quality is so amazing and elite, you don‚Äôt need to worry about battery it‚Äôs smooth and long lasting, (can pair with a 13w for a bit faster charging and it lasts a bit longer). The looks are ultimate and of course it is hard and sturdy as they say. It is so small it perfectly fits your palm like you can type with just one hand and also its so tiny in pocket, you won‚Äôt feel a thing.Only two things I miss are-touch ID (a very lot) and-personally, I‚Äôm not a big fan of the new full screen displays. Like I‚Äôve had my peace with the older type, but its Good too.It felt weird at first with the small screen while switching from bigger mobile. After regular use it‚Äôs really comfortable to move my eyes just little to look at my phone."
4,Aniruddha, 12 May 2021,5.0 out of 5 stars,Tiny Giant,"I had a few worries about battery life going into this phone but the form factor was too good to pass up on, and to my pleasant surprise, I got a full 7 hours and change of screen on time with Bluetooth on the whole day and lots of camera usage (approx 1 hour). With the added benefit that it‚Äôs small battery size makes it charge super fast even on an 18W charger (charging speeds comparable to oneplus‚Äôs dash charging, unfortunately I didn‚Äôt time it) you won‚Äôt be having any trouble on the battery frontIn all other aspects too, it‚Äôs a wonderful phone to use. Media consumption is no issue either, with the near complete edge to edge, super sharp screen, and after a few minutes, our brain ignores the notch (which unfortunately is still huge)Typing comes easily too, even though it takes a few hours to get used to. However, the feeling of being able to touch all four corners of the screen with one hand is just amazing, and if you‚Äôre someone who isn‚Äôt a fan of phones reaching tablet sizes then this is definitely the pick for youPeace"
5,Rakesh Menon, 7 May 2021,5.0 out of 5 stars,Go for it if you want a compact iPhone,"Delivery :- As usual spot on got the phone jaut before lockdown at my place.Battery Life :- Average, can last a day depending on your usage. But battery drain is there since its a pretty powerful chip eventhough the screen is 5.4‚Äù.Screen :- Beautiful OLED screen doesnt make me miss 120hz.Device overall :- Compact, powerful, beautifully craft piece and can be used pretty easily with one hand.Who is this device for :-  a. Those who are tired of big screen phones.  b. Who dont do hardcore gaming.  c. Who isnt glued to their phone 24/7 - SOT will be around 8 hr mark for normal use.  d. Who want the best iPhone but cant splash a hell lot of moneyü§™I love this iteration of iPhone even though its small and its a lot better than iPhone SE."
6,Aravind, 4 August 2022,5.0 out of 5 stars,Ideal for what it is,"Ever since the first One plus, I'd been moving towards phablet sized phones, consuming more content, holding heavier devices, bending down at work, bed, bathroom, all glued to the large display. I never imagined what it could lead to until I got a slipped disc in my neck this year, requiring a surgery on my spine.Was initially astonished how I could get this at my age, but the doctor mentioned that this is very typical among his younger patients now - thanks to the way we work and consume entertainment, glued to the phone. My one plus 7 pro had also just given up on the fancy raising camera at the same time. Looking around for a small phone, came across the 12 mini. Being an android person, I had never even known about the 12 or 13 mini when the launched. The price difference between the 12 and 13 mini is too big (15-20k), and went with the 12 mini despite the battery concerns.In dark mode, with background app refresh off, 4G + wifi, and around 40% brightness (with auto brightness on), I'm easily getting 6+ hours of screen on time with 25% battery left at end of day. Not a gamer - uses are mainly around the social media apps, e commerce, food delivery, cab hailing, maps and chrome browsing. And the occasional camera captures.Picking up my old phone now feels like a chore - my fingers and shoulders hurt less, and I lose out on nothings compared to the old phone. In fact, a couple of One plus 7 pro updates had made the battery drain even faster (4-5 hrs) than what I'm getting out of iOS.My only worry is how I'll get to keep the same size going forward, since there's going to be no 14 mini. So long as the phone is your tool, 12 mini is a powerful, tiny, and definitely battery adequate. If you're like me a few months back, when you're plugged into the matrix via your phone - this is not for you."
7,Gunwal, 18 March 2021,5.0 out of 5 stars,One of the best iPhone ever launched,"One of the best iPhone ever made, have been using for more than a month now and assuming it‚Äôs a right time to share my experience with an iconic iPhone.PlusesAesthetics - simply phenomenal, no more need to hold with two hands while writing a text or sending messageWeight- super light phone to hold even with coverPerformance- A14 Bionic chip is super fast and get all work done with an easeCamera - one of the best camera phone i have used in recent times, no comparison between iPhone pro max pictures otherwise it‚Äôs super bright and clear even night pictures are decent comparative to old iPhonesDeltasPower adapter and Earphones are not available which is a bummerBattery life could have been betterOne request to all iPhone users out their, please buy iPhone 12 mini and I‚Äôm sure u fall for it every day and revive ur iPhone 4,4s,5 and 5s memories.Thanks,Saurabh Gunwal"
8,Hariharasudan Thiyagamoorthi, 13 February 2021,5.0 out of 5 stars,An unplanned upgrade from iPhone SE (1st Gen) - but totally happy with the upgrade!,"It has been more than 3 weeks since I got the new iPhone 12 mini.I have been an Apple customer since 2013. The first one was an iPhone 5. I had been using a 1st Gen iPhone SE since mid 2017. Even today the iPhone SE is a beast for regular usage. I had started loving the new iPhone 12 mini since its launch - as I like the flat edges and the small size.However, I had no plans to upgrade now. I usually wait until the new technologies (the full screen OLED display for example) to become stable and mature enough. I also wait until the model I like is a year or more old, so that the price is much lower than the launch price. But, my iPhone SE which had survived several falls earlier, suffered another fall and this time the touch stopped responding. The screen replacement cost was almost as much as the price I had paid for that phone.I got a decent offer on the purchase of the new iPhone 12 mini on Amazon. As expected Amazon delivered a factory sealed phone, well packed, the very next day. Setting the new phone up was very easy being an Apple Customer already. I just had to upgrade the OS and restore from my iCloud Backup.I like the white color body and the glass back. Having used to the bezels of the iPhone SE, the bezel less screen is the most I like from my upgrade. The 12 mini is slightly bigger than the 1st Gen SE but the different in the viewable area is so amazing. I also like the OLED screen so much.Battery has not been a problem for me as I do not play any games. So, even 24 hours after a full charge, I am left with about 30%. I have not experienced any heating during charging or during normal use.The 4G speeds are noticeably increased compared to the 1st Gen SE. The WiFi speeds have a big jump. Everything downloads so fast. I do have a router at home that supports MIMO and I connect on the 5GHz channel.I have been mostly on the WiFi so far. I don't know how the battery life will be when I am out using 4G data for 8-12 hours a day.Overall I am happy with my purchase so far!"
9,Siddharth, 2 July 2021,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Felt current on phone body while charging, poor wifi connection","Well the delivery was super fast, 5 stars for this.I‚Äôm writing my first review on day 1 of usage:First of all really pissed with Apple hypocrisy of not providing charger. The phone was delivered with 10% battery and how do you feel when you purchased a brand new phone and couldn‚Äôt switch it on. Pathetic. Had to rush to istore to get a new chargerWell about charging: I can feel light current running on side panels of the phone while charging with apple 20w charger. I don‚Äôt know if this is normal or this is some defect. I would be happy to know views of an expert on this.Also I‚Äôm not able to set up WiFi on the phone. I don‚Äôt know something is wrong . The WiFi just does not connect. Have tried everything.Will keep on writing reviews with daily useDay2 of usage:Charged dropped to 60% within 8 hours with single 4gsim and no WiFi.WiFi connectivity issue- iPhone 12 gives hard time connecting to WiFi. It was not connecting to my home WiFi just because it had weak password! I mean seriously üôÑ. I changed my router password to the strongest I could imagine and it got connected but still showing weak password. What the heck. Apple if you are reading this then please try to fix this through some update or bug fix you better know. Moreover I went out and came back and same problem recurred . I had to do all over again to get this connected.Here is Day3 &4 review: battery backup is decent. I did not experienced sudden battery drop as read in few reviews online."
10,Sawal Kalra, 4 May 2021,4.0 out of 5 stars,The mighty mini,Did the device meet my expectations? I guess after 2 months of research i pretty much knew all the pros and cons of the device before buying it so i knew what i was getting into. Overall id say that im satisfied with the device.Over the internet mostly the complaints had been regarding the battery life of the Mini and honestly it didnt bother me at all. Gets me through the day easily and with a fast charger it charges up pretty quick aswell.The issue that conerns me is initially when the phone came out it had touch problems while using with a case and screen protector which apple has fixed but i feel that while the phone is charging the touch tends to misbehave.Phone might heat up while charging or playing alot of games.You might think that the screen size is too small for you but honestly switching over from bulky oneplus phones i feel this is more appropriate even with big hands.. i do make some mistakes while typing but ehhh you‚Äôll get used to it. The quality of the display very much makes up for its size and watching HDR videos in 4k is just amazing.With the prices going down i would recommend going for a regular iPhone 12 but if the mini is something that suits your budget more you should go for it.
11,vinay k., 8 June 2021,4.0 out of 5 stars,good,"Overall good product. after installing airtel sim it is not detecting at all. previously i installed the sim on oneplus device and it worked smooth. i thought defect piece was delivered and thought simtray is not detecting the card. Tried all the basic troubleshooting steps seeing in youtube and also with apple customer care. they said to contact airtel customer care. The main problem is that old sim cards dont work with this series it seems. i got new sim card next day and placed it. Voila... signal bars appeared and everything is good. getting battery life of 2 days with minimum usage.My daily usage patterns are:1.5hrs of whatsappless than an hour callingan hour of browsing dailyhalf an hour youtube. thats it. No bullshit games and other social medias. I can easily get 2 days of battery life.call quality is also superb. I tried airtel 4g testing with 12mini and redmi note 9 pro max. 12mini iam getting download speeds of 50mbps,and for redmi same sim it is giving 30 to 35mbps speed in hyderabadCon:No charging adapter. If apple really cares for environment then they could have provided lightning to usb-a cable. because every household has that charging adapter.it is clearly visible the greediness of apple for making money."
12,RAHUL PRASAD, 8 February 2021,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Compact phone in the market,"This is my first-time experience IOS/iPhone because I have been an Android user from the start. I was tired of the large phone, and I was looking for a compact phone, but there is no option available on the Android side hence, I switched to an iPhone. Here are my initial experience, I won't call it a value for money phone even after applying the offers, it's still a bit expensive.Pros:1. Camera: I don't take that many photos but, I can say the photos, look great especially the videos there, is no comparison from the android side.2. Battery Life (I am using two sims): This was one of the areas of concern when ordering this phone, but I am relieved to say the battery life is good it's a one-day phone.3. Privacy and security: The best part, users have control over apps on what they can access and whatnot.4. OS Fluidity: The cohesiveness of the IOS is great previously, I have been using an android phone having a higher refresh rate screen, but I am not feeling any difference in day to day usage because of the cohesion and fluidity of the OS.Cons:Coming from Andriod you are used to doing things in a simple manner, but in IOS there are certain things that require extra steps or missing features. For example, in android, if you what to call someone, you just need to type the initials of that person on the dial pad, and you will get the suggestion, but you cannot do this on IOS.Dual sim options on Andoird is way better.This is my initial impression after using the Phone for 10 days. I Will update after using the phone for a bit longer."
13,Reema M., 20 March 2021,5.0 out of 5 stars,I am in love with my iPhone 12 mini,"1. This is my first Apple phone. Also I wanted a small sized phone. So this is good for me.2. I don't use phone much. For social media like insta, FB, YouTube I use only for 1 hour. So battery life isn't a problem for me. I charge it in the morning and it goes till 8-9 PM. And still it works. The phone never got to 0% battery.3. I switched off the automatic brightness option for the battery to last long.4. Usually I switch on the mobile data or wifi if only I am using it continuously. Otherwise I keep it off. It saves me from unnecessary notifications and also help me keep the battery alive. I used to do it even when I was using and Android phone.5. If you need a small phone and if you are an average user of phone then you can go for it. But if you are a heavy user I would recommend iPhone 12 or the bigger versions - 12 pro max.. Etc.6. Very powerful. Convenient to use. And the most beautiful thing is it is small and goes inside my pocket so comfortably.7. Do use a cover/case. That way you can increase the grip. Otherwise it may slip away from your hands.8. I have also purchased an apple charger 20 W. So it gets charged faster.9. Firstly it was a little difficult for me to move from Android to iPhone. But trust me you'll get used to it. I am still learning it's features and tricks to use.10. I won't write about the specifications coz those are available."
14,Krupa, 31 March 2021,4.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome phone... os updates are needed to fix ui issues,"Everything is amazing except that the screen and os is so buggy. Almost all of the non-apple apps fail to work properly around the top edges of the screen.The keyboard has so so many issues and fails to pop up. This often happens when you use some non-apple app.They have done a horrible job with the OS resolving the resolution to the mini size. Simple apps like YouTube and Netflix feel glitchy on rotation.This is my first iPhone and I wasn‚Äôt aware that most of the apps that run fine on android have crazy ui glitches on iPhone. Perhaps the lack / quality of iOS development is to blame. But even the popular ones feel slow and glitchy on iPhone mini.I was skeptical at first with the online forums complaining about touch insensitivity and Lock Screen issues. Although I haven‚Äôt faced them yet extremely, I am pretty sure they are true and got fixed over time with updates.All things put together, it is a great small screen phone with great specs but at a high price. The software updates are desperately needed to fix the screen issues though."
15,Placeholder, 16 March 2021,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing phone and perfect size,"It's the one iPhone that you should buy. I have been an Android user since I started using smartphones and never planned to buy an iPhone. But this phone had caught my attention and primarily because of it's size. It's impossible to find a good phone with small size now. Anything more than 5 to 5.5 inch and we are almost looking at a phablet like screen. But thanks to 12 mini, the true phone size is back.One will get used to the small size within couple of days. In-fact the screen size doesn't feel small because of the thinner and smaller bezels. I have no issues with the battery life and it gives me full day of normal usage. I don't play games and don't spend hours watching videos. If the requirement is to use your phone for everything starting from hours of media streaming to playing high graphics games then look elsewhere. It's a perfect small phone with a reasonable battery and one should know that fact before buying.Great camera and great performance as expected from any iPhone. No problem with Amazon delivery with good discounts."
16,Anik Biswas, 14 May 2021,4.0 out of 5 stars,Small beast!,"Pros-1. Really impressed with the in hand feel. Seriously it feels like a lovely toy.2. Impressive screen quality.3. Performance is top notch smooth.4. Camera is good . The night mode is extraordinary I mean look at the 2nd pic. So clear even with just one bulb glowing in the background. (Edit : night mode is good but is defeated by x70 pro+ Night mode which is far better). However, there were times during sunset when the sun captured looked like a huge balloon instead of what it actually is.Cons -1. Ofc the battery. For a light user like me, it's OK but definitely not for heavy users.2. No touch id.  A 65k phone with no touch id . Slow claps. (Apple are modern day scammers). Even a 6000rs Micromax has that."
17,AKB, 13 September 2021,4.0 out of 5 stars,Mini is not made for all,"Writing review after 6months of use.Had been a android user before andI think iPhones are over rated overall !!!About this particular variant iPhone 12 mini,If you use limited screen time and have a good eyesight to watch small screen, this is for you !!!Really a bad battery life but that‚Äôs common in all the iPhones üò´Great portibility with small form factor, easy to carry in pocket is the biggest advantage of this phone.You get all features of iPhone12 in the mini.This is a future ready phone with 5G support.I purchased this phone to control my screen time and to carry it comfortably in pocket without adding any bulge, that serves the purpose."
18,Gajendra Singh, 2 March 2021,5.0 out of 5 stars,Ideally powerful and wholesome elegant package,"It‚Äôs display quality is amazing, finally OLED display in all its range. The battery is very decent and will give approx 8 hours on a full charge if you are continuously on the phone to include social media, browsing, games and watching videos. However for me it lasts the entire day ie about 12hrs plus as I am not much into gaming. The camera is awesome specially the night mode would have been better if the telephoto lens could have been included too. The size of the mini phone is equivalent to an iPhone 7, don‚Äôt expect the overall form to be bigger then it. From the size point of view its  ideal for those who like the iPhone 6/7/8 size. The 60Hz refresh rate could have been more to 90/120Hz at this price point. Apple definitely needs to do something about the notch as it becomes cumbersome and annoying while watching video‚Äôs. Overall being an iPhone user it‚Äôs a good upgrade from those using iPhone 6/7/8 but not much of an upgrade for those using iPhone X or 11 barring the OLED display."
19,Shiju 183A, 26 March 2021,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best in class except for the battery life,"Quality of the phone is no where compromised, exceptional look and feel, very compact yet heavy powerful. Camera is excellent as we expect from apple, usage of applications are extremely smooth. High end graphics games works like a charm, 4K video editing is silky smooth as well. Only big disadvantage in this phone is the battery life, it is very pathetic. Hardly stands for a day with medium level of usage, when I say medium jus browsing YouTube a while, listening some music from iTunes, using camera a while and few phone calls and chats. On a heavy usage day battery needs to be charged twice at least, heavy usage for me considered as taking videos and using the edit suite for a while, playing some music, browsing and some phone calls and chats. It is understandable that smaller the phone smaller the capacity of the battery however when a price is being paid for the premium phone, it will be only fair if apple can improve in this area as well with some innovations."
20,NAZMEEM ANAM ISLAM, 19 May 2021,5.0 out of 5 stars,POCKET SIZE ROCKET,
21,Vikash, 6 July 2022,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent except battery,Writing this review after using for more than 1 year -Pros-SpeedNo lagging or hang problemAudio quality with apple wired earphone is superbSecurity system is bestLight weight (only 139grm approx)Cons-Battery backupScreen quality (60-90fpm)I brought it for 55000 in Jan 2021. So at that time it was very economic deal.But will suggest to not to buy mini version of any iPhone. Go with pro or normal version if your budget allows.
22,Aman Raj, 18 March 2021,5.0 out of 5 stars,Terrific,Writing this review after 3 months of use-The phone is smaller than I expected if you watch contents on mobile then don‚Äôt go for it.Let me tell u what‚Äôs important-After first month my iPhone 12 mini got freezed with no response.So I have to take the phone to nearby apple customer service centre and they took the phone did some checks and told me that my phone will be sent to bangaluru for further diagnostics and repairing.I didn‚Äôt liked that they are saying that I hv to stay without my phone for 10 days.Actually something more disturbing was that a new apple phone gets this much problem.I was disappointed. My phone was returned and the issue they told was that the motherboard was replaced.So all this was very kind of bad experience.Now it‚Äôs doing good.Thank you. Sorry for grammatical mistakes!!!
23,Vivek bhat, 30 June 2021,5.0 out of 5 stars,It is not just a phone it is an iphone and it will always be special,"No matter what people say an iPhone is an iphone. I have been used 3 generation of iphone and well i‚Äôm must i was never disappointed. This iphone mini too, it is really good.Excellent crystal sharp display, amazing one of the best in the market camera setup, no battery issue(easy it will last for a day or till evening even with heavy usage).Just go for it. If you are heavy photographer or wanna put lot of games then would suggest to go for 128gb one. Because memory issue may occur only if you are planning to use it for very long time or if you are an already IOS used and have almost full data on your existing phone."
24,Kaushik Kumar, 31 January 2022,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good quality phone with worlds best mobile chip inside,"Awesome. Product as described. I use WhatsApp(20-30min), mail(15-20min), internet(10-15min), phone(about 10-15 incoming calls not more than 2 min. and 10-12 outgoing calls not more than 3 min. & Apple TV(about 1hr) and my battery lasts almost up to 40 hr. Its a feature packed phone with worlds best mobile chip inside. Hats off to Appario Retail for such an excellent deal. Product & service quality what they supply deserves 5 star by default. Thank you Appario Retail. I will certainly buy from this seller in coming days."
25,Giang Nguyen, 22 February 2021,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic mini phone for photo shooting,"I was confused by choosing the iPhone 12 or iPhone 12 mini because it has the same specification. The difference are size and battery life. The iPhone 12 mini is smaller than iPhone 7 a bit but it has the longer screen. It is very comfortable for me to keep in the jean pocket. Very powerful camera for selfie, landscape with HDR/night mode auto assistant, HDR video recording. Since I do not use the iPhone 12 mini to play game, the battery life is ok for me to use for basis activities: WhatsApp, call, Facebook, Safari, Linkedin, etc..I used the my iPad to watch the Youtube so the small screen of iPhone 12 mini (compared to iPhone 12) is not important. Suggest to buy if you need a small phone with powerful camera and had the iPad for movie watching."

27,Abhishek, 21 February 2021,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect Compact Smartphone you‚Äôll never regret,"A very compact , lightweight and a handy powerhouse ever.With an OLED display and processor A14 same as the high end model, 12 Mini is excelling smartphone industry with a 5.4 inch screen in a small body. The battery is really sufficient (Manageable and good for a little gaming and heavy activities). I had iPhone XR before this and compared to that , the battery is pretty similar and 12 mini is more efficient than older models (Based on usage and standby time) .I am highly satisfied with iPhone 12 Mini as this was the phone i have always wanted.This review might not appeal to large screen users as some love small screen and some do not! But this is the best in the world if you are considering for a small screen smartphone."
28,Amazon Customer, 11 June 2022,1.0 out of 5 stars,"For a phone that costs upward of 60,000 INR, it's not reliable enough","I have never written a review before but, felt compelled to write this time due to the appalling experience I have had with my iPhone 12 mini. This phone worked as expected from the day of purchase till it switched itself off in the 14th month of use. The phone could not be revived through all means suggested by the staff at Apple's contact center and was advised to take it to a service center. The personnel at the service center did a diagnosis and and told me that the IC and the motherboard was faulty and would have to replaced. The amount for replacement would be 32,000/-INR.I am at a loss for words to understand how a device that costs upwards of 60,000 INR can have such a major failure within 14 months of usage. I had taken very good care of the device, this being my first iPhone and also because it is an expensive phone for a person from middle class like me. A spigen case protected the phone and another spigen glass shield was also used to guard the screen. The phone did not have a single fall as well.If all electronic goods are prone to such failures, shouldn't a premium device like the iPhone be less susceptible to such failures. If not, there is no point in purchasing them. One might as well buy a phone in the budget segment. My suggestion to all prospective buyers of the iPhone would be to buy an extended warranty for your own peace of mind or buy a cheaper android phone in the budget range. If not, there is a possibility of my fate befalling you. As for myself, I have learnt my lesson, I will  stick to the budget end of the phones, where I am less likely to be shocked by such major failures. If Apple does not get it's act together, it's only a matter of time before they fail."
29,Varun Nambiar, 21 April 2021,4.0 out of 5 stars,Something between iPhone 5s and 6s,"If you have been a fan of iPhone 5s for its compact size and looking for something similar with super powered configurations. Go for it.Battery backup is good, that actually depends on what all apps you use and how long you are on the onscreen apps.Battery backup is going to be likewise even in iPhone 12 PRO (with great screen comes great battery usage)Over 1 year of use - it seems like battery requires to be replaced every one year. Battery capacity is now at 77%"
30,Shailendra, 15 April 2021,5.0 out of 5 stars,Smooth as butter,"I‚Äôm loving it. The size is what I like the most. Fits easily in one hand and also in my pocket. Actually it doesn‚Äôt seem to me a small phone. Not heavy at all. Screen touch is as smooth as butter. I have migrated from iPhone 6 to this. There are no black bands on the top and bottom like what is there in iPhone 6 or iPhone SE 2020. Till now the battery backup also seems to be ok , maybe because my usage is not much and the phone is not even 10 days old. If I charge 100% on day one morning , the battery shows 20% on the afternoon of day two. Delivery by Amazon was top notch as usual and I got a good deal too."

33,Neeraj, 12 December 2020,5.0 out of 5 stars,1st Gen SE to the iPhone 12 mini - a BIG Leap,"I skipped all the round edged iphone and stuck to my 1st Gen SE. Always hated the rounded edges of the iPhone 6 up until 11.The 12th gen got back the original design and I made my mind to upgrade. Quite worth every penny, I must say.Numerous reviews here and on youtube. So i wont get there.Battery life is sufficient for me as a light user. You may want to go for the iPhone 12 with the bigger screen and battery of you're a heavy user.I'm happy as I get a lot more screen for almost the same size of the 1st Gen SE. Camera is crazy amazing.And of course to future proof, there's the 5G tech you get with it.I won't fret about not having a charging brick in the box. I've got an iPad 20w charger and it does its job well."
34,Abhilasha, 1 June 2021,4.0 out of 5 stars,Handy product from Apple,Amazing!!If you‚Äôre thinking of updating from iPhone 6/7 series then this might be the best option for you. A true iPhone 12 (5G) in compact size.The size is perfect of one hand usage. The battery however isn‚Äôt as great as iPhone 12 due to the small size of the battery.Accessories you get- only a C- type with lightening end  cable for MagSafe chargers!P.s - you don‚Äôt get any charging adapters or earpods
35,kavya, 8 May 2021,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Lagging a step only because of battery, else 5 star.","As the name says, it is small but handy. Only drawback is battery. Bought at 58999, apple is always overpriced. We are paying just for the brand, if you are extreme pro phone user who will explore all the features and use effectively then go ahead and buy 12 series.Battery needs to be charged every day, if you are a gamer don't buy 12mini. Apart from this iPhone mini is at its best."
36,Shalu RV, 6 July 2022,5.0 out of 5 stars,Who can review iPhone?,"The camera, look, performance is classy! I purchased this to gift because of the size. The person wanted small sized phone and not any Android phones of 6 or + inches. This 8s indeed on higher side as compared to Android but again it's worth spending on it. Well, honestly who can review an iPhone? üòä This is beyond comparison in everything including costüòÑ"
37,Hardik Panjwani, 24 August 2021,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect size for one handed use,"Apple being Apple, this phone is well designed and a pleasure to use.The bet part is the size that makes it a great daily driver. Battery usually lasts for 1.5 days and charges quickly when plugged in. Wireless charging is slower but can easily be done overnight.Photos and videos are excellent, call quality is crisp and security features are top notch.The only complaint I have is the camera bump. Making the body bigger would eliminate the bump and make space for a larger battery."
38,Saravanan G, 14 February 2021,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great smartphone,"Thanks to Apple for hearing the customer voice to bring in (another) small screen  flagship mobile that‚Äôs easy to handle with one hand.This is my second iPhone and I‚Äôve upgraded from SE first gen to 12mini.Undoubtedly it was the best choice for those who like small screen smartphone.Camera quality is great and it‚Äôs good in capturing Night mode, Wide angle and Portrait mode photos. It can capture video upto 4K 60fps, which is close to real-time recording.Sound quality is also good with Dolby playback and stereo video recording.It‚Äôs same spec as iPhone 12 with 5.4‚Äù screen.I‚Äôm getting 5+ hours of screen on time with regular use of watching YouTube, Insta, and WhatsApp. Battery life is good.Really a satisfying upgrade from SE1 .."
39,Vijay Raj Jayaraj, 19 June 2021,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Phone if You need that Apple can Offer,"If you can't spend on an iPhone pro/iPhone, but need every function of it at a cheaper price, then this is the one. There is no difference between higher-end models and this one, except for size and a few small differences. This is much better than Oneplus, the competitor in this price range. Apple has erased the difference between models and this is a power-packed small-sized iPhone with all the same performance as higher-end models.The battery is good. No over-heating. Smooth operation. Enough memory even on the lowest memory model. The camera is better than one plus and most of Samsung, except for S21 Ultra."
40,Rajan Ramamoorthy, 31 January 2021,5.0 out of 5 stars,Mini is the new Mega,Mini in size but mega in performance.One of the best creations from Apple in the recent memory is the 12 mini.Very compact to hold and excellent grip. Ultra fast for a person upgrading from 7 plus to 12 mini.Battery would easily last for a day as I don‚Äôt play games or on social media.I love photography and this phone with its easy grip and fast access to camera is a boon.Photos come out good in all conditions.Voice quality is excellent.Face ID is fast.4G network seems to be stronger than the 7 plus.Overall a dynamite packed in the comfort of your palms.Go for it guys

43,Vk, 5 February 2021,4.0 out of 5 stars,You get what you pay for.,"Similarly specced android handsets are available for supposedly much (much much) cheaper. Some people buy iPhones because it's sort of a status symbol. I couldnt care less about that. I just tend to value my privacy a bit more than what android pays me (in terms of cheaper upfront handsets).As far as review of the phone is concerned, there are many available online. I'd simply say that I'm more than satisfied with this."
44,Swaroop, 16 February 2021,4.0 out of 5 stars,iPhone 12 mini - A good buy,Imperative to say that the experience has been awesome. Recently migrated from Android to iPhone. Battery life is ok for one day use if your onscreen time is below 6hrs. Screen quality is awesome and you can really see the difference while watching HDR Content. Buttery smooth operations. Moving from Android to Apple will take some getting used to. Camera quality is awesome specially portrait mode
45,Yasch, 31 January 2021,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth to buy! üòä,"Whoooaaa! Posting review after using it for almost 2 months.The phone is mini and easily fits in your hand.Pros & ConsEasy to carryBattery is good average screen time will be 6 to 7 hrs for a moderate use. On official days the battery lasts for almost full day under normal use.Easy to handle and operate with one hand.Camera is superb. Photos and video quality is great.Typing on keyboard can be issue in the beginning because of screen size but once u get used to, it is fun.Overall the phone is best in its class."
46,Hari Rao, 13 April 2021,5.0 out of 5 stars,Super phone,"It is a beautiful phone. Absolutely no issues. I was worried about battery before purchase. But it is very good for a normal user. I was in doubt whether to go for iPhone SE 2 or 12 mini. But screen made the huge difference. Call quality, cameras, speakers are all superb. Using M51 as secondary phone. In my use case, attending calls, texting, occasionally watching YouTube, checking emails, news, WhatsApp, updating apps daily and by fully optimising the battery usage, iPhone 12 mini easily lasts me around two and half to three days. I did not expect this. Apple products though very pricey, offer very pleasant user experience."
47,vCare, 9 February 2021,5.0 out of 5 stars,Honest Review on Battery,"This is a honest review, especially for those hesitating to buy this mini beast because of other reviews on battery life.I have been using iPhone since iPhone 6 onwards and upgraded from iPhone X to this iPhone mini 12. I am in love with this phone. So cute, just the right size for my hands (my hands are actually large and I need large gloves for my hands). This is great for one handed operation and screen is clear like crystal.Regarding battery life, it‚Äôs 40% remaining after 24 hours and might come for complete 36 to 48 hours which is excellent. I am an average phone user.Over all a great premium feeling with this iPhone.Update on Camera quality - the best camera even in low light conditions and indoors, including front camera."
48,P.M, 23 November 2020,5.0 out of 5 stars,Beast of a small phone ! Awesome ! No regrets !,"It‚Äôs a beast inside a small form factor ! Great camera for taking photos and videos. Super fast processor and amazing OLED display ! I am using the blue color and loved the same. Battery life is alright considering device size. If you don‚Äôt play games it should sustain 12 hours or moderate use. There are some lag with the touch response at times ( with case on ) but I am sure Apple will address the same with software update. Anyone who using iPhone 10 and below along cab consider upgrading without any doubt. For iPhone 5/ 5S / 5SE users, it‚Äôs a perfect phone to upgrade to !"
49,Jay, 5 February 2021,5.0 out of 5 stars,After all it‚Äôs iPhone....,"After all it‚Äôs iPhone no need to mention anything personally I like the size of phone it‚Äôs perfect for every hand, look and feel really premium. Speaker output is average not loud compared to my redmi k20 pro which has single down firing speakers. Camera is awesome but limited options with camera app. Only battery is little downstairs but enough for moderate use.Finally I got it for 55k on Amazon with HDFC 9k instant discount which is worth buy.If u want small size big bomb then go for iPhone 12 mini u will never regret abt it."
50,Prince, 1 June 2021,2.0 out of 5 stars,It is the first-ever iPhone in my life but I'm not impressed!,"I love compact size phones so I bought this model without a second thought. It is the first-ever iPhone in my life but I'm not impressed!1. The camera gives some weird issues during the night when there are street lights. Light strikes over the lamps, Light flares & ghosting issues when you focusing on the LED panels. This issue is not occurring in the ultra-wide lenses but on the standard lens. (I'm a freelance cinematographer & Photographer for 8yrs). I don't know why the YouTubers are not addressing this issue while testing the iPhone Camera, particularly at night with the light source. If there is NO light source in the frame, then it will take good photos.2. The phone gets a High temp alert while using the G-Maps for about 15min continuously even in an a/c room. Strange!3. No straightforward call recording apps available for iOS.( You should MERGE the calls and even the paid apps are not reliable.)Pixel 4A & other premium brands android phones are best while handling these types of issues when compared to iPhone 12 mini. The funny part is, the Apple customer care executive has NO ideas regarding that night camera issue. I'm returning back to flagship Android phones as the iPhone 12 mini is not worth my usage.Bye, Bye iPhone!  Hello Android!Things I like with 12 mini- Compact Size, Compact Size,  Compact Size- Video quality at 10bit & Photo quality-  iOS stability & updates"

57,Teja, 21 December 2020,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth it when you love compact than anything!,"All in all good phone those who loves compact phones. I have identified few things those who complain about battery life. Try these to improve battery life,1) try mobile data, bluetooth when not needed. With these two being on, I noticed considerable battery drain.2) when you are in remote places, try put it in airplane mode. This keeps phone searching for the network all the time and drains battery.3) hey Siri, please turn off yourself. I don't use it anymore. Keeping Siri always on is not a good thing.This might help!"

I think it may be a concern if you constantly play games.  With normal use of occasional calls, videos, songs and browsing, it comes 1 full day easily.  Rest of the aspects about the phone are of course the best - speed, screen and the FORM FACTOR!  Great to use a solid phone that is small and fits the hand."

Battery is dead completely. I am a loyal I phone user. Didn‚Äôt expect from Apple to get a defective product.Adding to my agony, Amazon team is harassing me for replacement. First they need a report from apple team that I phone is defective and when I get that for replacement, Amazon delivery boy wants the phone to start so that he can inspect. There is no coordination between Amazon customer care and delivery team and now the delivery agent took the new phone back without giving me the replacement and I am again chasing Amazon team to send an email to delivery team to pick up the I phone and instruct them that defective phone will not get switched on. Buyers beware. This can happen to you."

I switched to this phone from galaxy note 9 and I feel the battery is pretty damn nice. It lasts all day even with heavy usage. No complaints so far.

80,Vishal Joshi, 5 March 2021,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best iPhone,"The best iPhone so far. I love this perfect size, more convenient, less hand gymnastics. Look at reviews at YouTube. It is the expert reviewers favourite iPhone as compared to 12 and 12 pro. I took a wise decision not to get lured by bigger screen size and an extra camera. I also purchased an Apple Watch series 6 along with it and combined price is still less than Apple iPhone 12 Pro. Best decision!!"
81,SAJAI BABY, 27 February 2021,5.0 out of 5 stars,Was waiting for this mini for a long time!,"Excellent phone, i‚Äôm loving this. Screen is bit smaller than iphone X. I‚Äôm actually getting very good battery life, not like what the YouTube reviewers say. For me this is an excellent phone with top notch camera and screen. Deep fusion image processing is next level, can‚Äôt imagine how good the low light images are! I‚Äôm very happy with this phone and more importantly it‚Äôs pocket friendly size and for easy one hand use!"
82,vishal sancheti, 30 April 2021,2.0 out of 5 stars,Grossly overpriced average phone,"It‚Äôs an iPhone... that is it... I have been using iPhone 5s and 6s since 2015 and got this only because of the mini size to fit in palm and carry around. And this is good only for that. Notch and bezels are very distracting. And somehow 6s was better type than this one.The phone in itself is good, it has a fine camera though telephoto lens is missed too much while taking portrait shots.Photos and videos are bright and good dynamic range, but it‚Äôs night mode is very ordinary specially selfies.But the biggest pain point are the speakers and battery. The speakers are ordinary compared to competition. It hardly gives 3-4 hours power on heavy usage. And around 5-5.5 hrs power on normal usage.If not for its small size I always prefer one plus 8 pro over this one which by the way is 15,000/- cheaper this phone even when I got mini on discount.This could have been a  solid 3.5 star phone if the price was right but it is definitely overpriced by at least 25-30k for the trade off you have to make at 70-75k phone you can get flagship level phones at this price. Take this only if you have to have small screen iPhone. It is of no other use."
83,Kumar Amit, 9 May 2021,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome...iPhone rocks,"Switched from 7 to 12mini and I am completely satisfied with my decision. As usual everything is perfectly fine form Apple in this phone. Amazing night photo quality and the best processor.Would have loved higher battery capacity, but the current battery backup is fine with me as I am not a heavy mobile user. However, it will be problematic for persons having heavy usage"
84,Brij Saxena, 12 February 2021,5.0 out of 5 stars,A great Product !!,The product is very good and powerful. The performance is amazing and the screen size is not as small as many people think. It's screen is bigger than the screen of Iphone SE and Iphone 8. Moreover it has exactly same features as Iphone 12 and almost all the features of Iphone 12 pro. Believe me it is a good choice. You can trust the amazon delivery as well. I got mine from amazon.
85,Phanindra Reddy, 11 March 2021,4.0 out of 5 stars,Its a true smart phone.... but with real battery probelm.,"Only and only drawback is battery, it‚Äôs worse than I thought. It always bothers  me when iam going out. It gets Juiced even without uing my phone.Other than the battery issue this phone is incredible, watch the pics i pasted here absolute phenomenal...."
86,Roshan Kumar Mehta, 28 August 2021,5.0 out of 5 stars,Superb Quality,"Before buying it I was really afraid because I‚Äôve heard a lot about Amazon cases but when I bought it and using it now from almost 4 month, now I can say whatever I have heard was just a rumours. This product is really amazing and I can refer Apple lover to buy it before any second thought."
87,Abhijit, 31 December 2020,4.0 out of 5 stars,Overall good,"Good phone with less battery. Remind me of my old sony z1 compact. Iphone 12 mini is a small beast you need to survive everyday. Great camera, great display. Water and dust resistance seems good for men with laborious activities like me. I wish battery could have been better."
88,Hari Murali, 10 February 2021,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very smooth operation and graphics,"With the OLED display and the A14 Bionic, you can expect a seamless and lighting speed  experience when it comes to shuttling between apps. Battery is a pain point, no doubt, but this compact phone is apt for a not-so-heavy user like me."
89,Pravin Durai, 29 May 2021,5.0 out of 5 stars,Happy purchase from Amazon. Apple did it finally small phone that‚Äôs fits into hands,After a long time switching from first Gen iPhone SE to 12 mini. Wonderful choice. Fits really well in hand.Screen quality is unbelievable. Speed is really good. Worried about 60hz but it feels smooth than many android..If you are planning to pick iPhone lineup. Often use game and less media then mini is great choice..
90,Swagath Kumar kolige, 5 August 2022,4.0 out of 5 stars,Only issue is you do something or not Battery drains so fast.,"Battery life is poor, performance super."
91,Manohar singh, 5 February 2021,4.0 out of 5 stars,Love it,"I ordered white one and performance is soo smooth soo smooth, in short i love it.. if you normal user like only web surfing or social its very good phone for you. Not for gaming or heavy or video shooting due to mini battery."
92,Amit D., 9 February 2022,5.0 out of 5 stars,Your phone needs to fit in your pocket.,I see no reason why people buy oversized phones just for a big screen.This one slides into my pockets so easily.TBH I would have bought the SE if it wasn‚Äôt for the 12 mini. But the processor matters and this one works awesome.
93,Aditi, 26 June 2021,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fabulous phone,battery remains an issue!","I upgraded from iPhone 7 to iPhone 12 mini.Definitely the new iPhone is better in terms of camera,sound and touch screen.However,battery is still an issue.It drains quite easily in basic functions like calling and whatsapping.The new phone requires one charging a day.If I use it heavily and watch vedios ,then the phone needs to be charged twice in a day."
94,Rick Dinsmen, 1 September 2021,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works like an Apple,12 mini is just the perfect size. Screen is bigger than the iPhone 7 it replaces and at the same time does not sag the pocket it resides in. OLED screen is also a pleasure to watch. Colours of the exact same picture look much more vibrant compared to normal Retina display of iPhone 7.
95,Akash Yadav, 22 October 2021,4.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect design,"Design is excellent, battery is good screen is good but camera is not of apple standard. My old iPhone XR has batter camera than this phone"
96,Juhi, 7 August 2021,4.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing product,"Very good performance,touch sensitivity, camera  quality for both selfie and back are good and storage is adequate for all my needs highly recommended good product at a good price :)"
97,Srikanth Jatla, 21 February 2021,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best phone at this size,I have been looking for an iPhone that‚Äôs smaller as a second phone with full screen and iPhone 12 mini has fulfilled by requirement. Everything an iPhone is in a smaller form factor. Brilliant as a second phone and if you are looking for smaller phones in a market that is crowded with above 6 inch smartphones which are a pain in the hand.
98,Akash, 6 August 2021,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best,I have been shifted from iphone 6s to this and it‚Äôs really great..! All performance is really great as compared to Iphone 11 except the fact that it has a small screen but if you feels great holding a small and handy phone in your hand then this mobile is for you..!
99,Kedarnadhsuram, 25 January 2021,5.0 out of 5 stars,Arbitrary discount offer,"The republic day sale is very amusing on this product pricing. This product now costs less than that was available during that sale. Hdfc provides more discount than the sbi card at the time of sale. Seeing this, I am Now Disappointed with this pricing at the sale time. Would have saved atleast INR 4,500 if I have bought this now using hdfc card. Rubbish"
